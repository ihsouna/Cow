	<p>I love to play volleyball for fun and competitvaly whenever there's good competition.</p>
	<p>Volleyball is a sport I'm able to play with my friends and it helps get my mind off my classes. I started playing my junior year in highschool and made my best friends while playing for my highschool team and are people I wouldn't want to lose. </p>
	<h2>Traveling is cool

	<p>I also love to travel, even though I have only gone to a few states where my family live which is Texass, Cali, South Carolina, and Florida. I would love to spend a good chunk of my life traveling and having seen what the world has to offer.</p>
	<p>One of the places I would love to go visit is Japan, I love the culture they have and would love to see the many anime places and food they offer. </p>
	<h2>I enjoy playing video games</h2>
